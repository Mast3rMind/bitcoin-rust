# bitcoin-rust [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/agi90/bitcoin-rust.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/agi90/bitcoin-rust)
A rust implementation of the Bitcoin protocol

I created this package mainly as a way to learn Rust.

This repo is under active development and work in progress, it's not intended to be used as a Bitcoin client.
